		<h1>ESEM</h1>
		<p>= a new type of SEM, which allows the examination of specimens in the presence of gases.</p>
		<p>=> wet and dry, insulating or conducting and, generally, all specimens can now be viewed with no or minimal preparation,
			in their natural state, or in vacuum.</p>

		<h1>ESEM…some history</h1>
		<p>The SEM’s primary limitations: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>restrictions on samples by requiring high vacuum sample environment.</li>
			<li>samples have to be clean, dry and electrically conductive.</li>
			<li>Nonconductive specimen have to be coated with conductive film to avoid specimen charging.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The ESEM was developed in the mid eighties. Its primary advantages lie in permitting the microscopist to vary the sample
			environment through a range of pressures, temperatures and gas compositions. </p>
		<p data-view-type="course"><strong>SAMPLE PREPARATION</strong></p>
		<p data-view-type="course">Before mounting samples for examination in the SEM, some preliminary treatment of most geological specimens is required.
		</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">First some cleaning might be needed in order to eliminate unwanted contaminants (for example washing of sediments and soils;
			removing unwanted carbonate, iron oxides, organic matter etc.). Some samples might be wet in their normal state and must
			be dried by gentle heating in the air, or by “freeze drying” (removal of water from frozen sample by sublimation in vacuum)
			or “critical-point drying” (removal of water by conversion of liquid into vapour, therefore water is first replaced by
			methanol and then by liquid carbon dioxide). </p>
		<p data-view-type="course">Friable and porous materials usually require impregnation, especially if polished samples are to be produced. The rocks
			require cutting to give pieces of suitable size and shape for mounting and polishing. Afterwards, the specimens for SEM
			examination are commonly mounted on a “stub”, which takes the form of a disc, usually made of aluminum and typically about
			1 cm in diameter. The sample is glued to the stub by using double-sided sticky tape and coated to provide conduction.
			In many cases, thin sections are required so that viewing by transmitted light is possible. Preparation is as for ordinary
			thin sections in the first stages, the rock slice being attached to the glass slide using one of the special epoxy resins.
			The slice is ground to a thickness somewhat greater than the 30 µm, before commencing polishing. </p>
		<p data-view-type="course">Most geological samples, being non-conductors of electricity, require a conductive coating to prevent charging under electron
			bombardment unless this is avoided by using an “environmental” or “low-vacuum” SEM. The preferred coating element for
			X-ray analysis is carbon, because it has a minimal effect on the X-ray spectrum. It is also the best choice for cathodoluminiscence
			studies. However, for SE imaging, owing to its low secondary-electron yield, it is not ideal. For this purpose a metal
			such as gold is preferable, but less suitable for X-ray analysis and BSE imaging. </p>
		<p data-view-type="course">The usual method of coating with carbon is to place the specimen in a vacuum chamber with a carbon evaporation source.
			Commonly, a high vacuum evaporator with carbon rods is used to achieve these coatings, and still has preferential applications.
			The optimum thickness of carbon is about 20 nm. Sputter coating is a convenient method for producing coatings of metal.
		</p>
		<p data-view-type="course"><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SEM DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
		<p data-view-type="course">Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) began to appear commercially in the mid nineteen sixties. The SEM’s primary limitations,
			as a general imaging and analytical technique, were the restrictions it imposed on samples by requiring a high vacuum
			sample environment. The samples had to be clean, dry and electrically conductive. Nonconductive specimen had to be coated
			with a conductive film to avoid specimen charging.</p>

			pumped, aperture-limited TEMs, or creation of ‘‘environmental chambers’’. The separation of high vacuum electron gun chamber
			from a gaseous specimen chamber via open diaphragms (PLA for pressure limiting apertures) was first used in several high-voltage
			TEM. Research by Danilatos and Robinson in the 1970s led to the first SEM capable of maintaining a relatively high pressure,

		<h1>ESEM…some history</h1>
		<p>ESEM became a stable instrument. </p>
		<p>By the late 1980s, the first commercial ESEMs were being produced, opening up a world of possibilities for observing untreated
			specimens. </p>
		<p>ESEM has rapidly gained acceptance by the scientific, technical and industrial community (↑ number of publications)</p>
		<p>Summary: ESEM differs from conventional SEM mainly by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Presence of a gas in the specimen chamber.</li>
			<li>Samples are thus not viewed under high vacuum but under a deteriorated or ‘‘low’’ vacuum.</li>
		</ul>
		<p data-view-type="course">Over more than two decades, Danilatos showed tenacity and developed the ESEM instrument to a point where the rest of the
			scientific community and manufacturing world could further benefit. ESEM became a stable instrument. By the late 1980s,
			the first commercial environmental scanning electron microscopes (ESEMs by Electroscan, a company created for the purpose
			of gaseous microscope manufacturing) were being produced, opening up a world of possibilities for observing untreated
			specimens. A few years later in 1996, a traditional electron microscope manufacturer Philips FEI took over the operation
			to further commercialize the instrument. Other manufacturers have in the meantime followed with low-vacuum systems reaching
			100 Pa, the level of pre-ESEM technology, probably due to patent restrictions (ESEM Research Laboratory, Australia).</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">The ESEM has rapidly gained acceptance by the scientific, technical and industrial community as shown by the large number
			of publications arising from its use. To summarize, ESEM differs from conventional SEM mainly by the presence of a gas
			in the specimen chamber. Samples are thus not viewed under high vacuum but under a deteriorated or ‘‘low’’ vacuum. This
			is possible thanks to a special design of electron optics column that allows differential pumping: the column is divided
			into different pressure zones separated by pressure limiting apertures (Danilatos, 1993). The presence of gas, or environment
			around the sample that inspired the term ‘‘environmental’’ SEM, can play two main roles. The first, common for environmental
			as well as low-vacuum SEMs, is electronic. The gas acts as an electrical charge conductor avoiding sample charging and
			facilitates signal detection. This first role is described in Fig. 62: collisions between electrons and gas molecules
			create positive ions that can balance the accumulation of negative charges on the surface of specimens, and ‘‘cascade’’
			electrons that help to amplify the signal collected by the gaseous secondary electrons detector (GSED). The second role,
			more specific to environmental SEMs, is thermodynamic, i.e. the gas is a conditioning medium, preventing evaporation of
			liquids from a sample (Thiel and Toth, 2005).</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">With this specialized form of electron microscopy a wide range of insulating materials, oils, liquids, etc., can be observed
			at equilibrium or during in situ evolutions. The potential applications are described in numerous recently published articles,
			in particular by Donald (2003).</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">ESEM also extends the possibilities of SEM in term of the wide variety of samples and of states that can be characterized.
			However, in the case of liquids, classical wet mode in ESEM only allows the observation of the surface, which is often
			very smooth so that very little information about the sample can be collected. Water vapour is the most common gas used
			in ESEM, due to its efficiency in signal amplification, and its useful thermodynamic properties leading to good quality
			images and specimen stability.</p>
